## My process

First I created a folder with all the files I'd need (images, html, css). Then I got those all set up (linking css to html, adding google fonts, pulling styles from the style-guide, etc.). I wrote the HTML first and the started figuring out how to code the CSS

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The main challenge I had was centering the card vertically. I experimented with a couple different solutions, but ultimately, I ended up making it a flexbox so that I could just the justify-content property.

### Continued development

I'm still fairly uncomfortable with flexbox and css grid, so I hope to get more experienced with them in the future.
